		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p> The idea of this ab was to further create a local file structure on my
			computer and add index.html files.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> It was fairly easy and the notes were super healpful. Although everytime
			I upload a picture on my html file it takes a long time to process and show the image.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Well you are looking at the index.html file I created. Here is the file structure I made:</p>

		<img src="img/SC1.jpeg" width=650>
		<img src="img/SC2.jpeg" width=650>
		<img src="img/SC3.jpeg" width=650>
