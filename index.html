			<h1>Hey, my name is Amir.</h1>

			<p>I am currently 22 years old majoring Computer Science Game Design.
			I moved to United States 6 years ago and let me tell you I enjoyed every
		  second of living here and in love with it. I am currently staying in
		  Irvine, OC due to the Santa Cruz housing crisis. I love this class and
		  enjoy learning a new skill from this course. Much love... Amir</p>
